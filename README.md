# ThousandTunes Music App (React.js)

##### Intro:
This type of client-side music app has become very popular, <br>
so I wanted to approach it with some adversities I might encounter in a company, <br>
such as the latest React.js with an earlier router-dom version, class components and fetching from larger APIs.


#### Technologies:
- React.js
- Css (no framework)

#### Project Requests:
- Create components using classes.
- Fetch albums by artist/band.
- Routes from Home page to Album page to tracks list and favorite list.
